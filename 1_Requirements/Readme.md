# Requirements
## Introduction
Calculators are very simple tool, which helps students to play with the problems. Since they eliminate tedious computations and algebraic manipulations that discourage many students, calculators allow more students to solve problems and appreciate the power and value of mathematics in the world today. This also increase the intrest towards mathematics.

## Research
Calculators also have the ability to store numbers into computer memory. Basic calculators usually store only one number at a time; more specific types are able to store many numbers represented in variables. The variables can also be used for constructing formulas. Some models have the ability to extend memory capacity to store more numbers; the extended memory address is termed an array index.

## Defining Our System
 In this the calculator has 10 operators :
 -Addition
 - Subtraction
 - Multiply
 - Division 
 - Squareroot 
 - Factorial 
 - Area_of_Rectangle
 - Area_of_Square
 - Area_of_Parallelogram
 - Area_of_Triangle

 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

 This calculation can be easily done by the anyone with accuracy.

## What:

Its most common use is for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division along with few other mathematical operations.

## When:

Whenever there is use of any calculations where large number is there, than we can't calculate just by mind then we use it.

## Where:

It can be used anywhere by anybody like students, faculty, business people to do calculations.

## How:

By entering the appropriate number that you wanted to calculate.
